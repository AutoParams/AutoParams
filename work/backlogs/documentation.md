# Documentation Improvements

## Problem Statement
1. The project lacks sufficient documentation, making it difficult for new developers to understand how to use it.
2. All information is contained in a single README.md file, which reduces readability.
3. Not all features are documented, making it hard for new developers to use the available functionality.
4. Writing tests in the test-autoparams-springboot project to verify that example code is actually runnable does not align with the original purpose of the project.

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Documentation Architecture Transformation

**Current State**:
- Single monolithic README.md file (1,096 lines)
- Mixed concerns: overview, installation, features, examples all in one file
- Difficult to navigate and maintain

**Target Architecture**:
```
README.md (Overview & Quick Start)
├── docs/
│   ├── getting-started/        # New user onboarding
│   │   ├── installation.md
│   │   ├── quick-start.md
│   │   └── first-test.md
│   ├── core-features/          # Essential AutoParams functionality
│   │   ├── basic-usage.md
│   │   ├── annotations.md
│   │   ├── factory.md
│   │   ├── designer.md
│   │   └── resolution-context.md
│   ├── advanced-features/      # Power user features
│   │   ├── customization.md
│   │   ├── freezing-strategies.md

│       └── src/
│           ├── main/java/examples/     # Shared domain models
│           │   ├── Product.java
│           │   ├── Review.java
│           │   ├── Order.java
│           │   └── User.java
│           └── test/java/examples/     # Runnable examples
│               ├── basic/
│               ├── core/

│               └── extensions/
```

### 2. Examples Subproject Solution

**Purpose**: Dedicated testing environment for documentation examples that solves Problem #4.

**Key Components**:
- Gradle subproject integrated with root project build system
- Realistic domain models shared across all examples
- Runnable test classes organized by feature category
- CI validation ensures documentation accuracy
- Clear separation from library's internal tests

**Benefits**:
- Removes documentation pollution from test-autoparams-springboot
- Provides single source of truth for all code examples
- Enables automated validation of documentation
- Makes examples easily discoverable and executable

### 3. Content Standards & Guidelines

**Writing Principles**:
- Progressive disclosure: basic → advanced concepts
- Practical examples with real-world domain models
- Clear prerequisites and next steps
- Consistent voice and terminology

**Structure Template**:
```markdown
# Feature Name
## Overview
## Prerequisites
## Basic Usage
## Advanced Patterns
## Common Pitfalls
## Next Steps
```

**Code Example Requirements**:
- All examples executable via examples subproject
- Include both Java and Kotlin where applicable
- Use consistent domain models (Product, Review, Order, User)
- Provide expected output and explanations

### 4. Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: Foundation**
- Set up directory structure and examples subproject
- Create domain models and basic infrastructure
- Migrate core getting-started content

**Phase 2: Core Features**
- Document Factory, Designer, and ResolutionContext
- Create comprehensive annotation reference
- Build examples for fundamental features

**Phase 3: Advanced & Extensions**
- Document customization patterns
- Create extension-specific guides
- Add troubleshooting and best practices

### 5. Quality Assurance

**Automated Validation**:
- CI pipeline runs all examples in docs/examples/ subproject
- Link checking for internal documentation references
- Version alignment between docs and library releases

**Manual Review Process**:
- Peer review for new documentation
- User testing with actual developers
- Regular audits for accuracy and completeness

This structured approach will transform the current single-file documentation into a comprehensive, maintainable documentation system that scales with the project's growth and makes AutoParams accessible to developers of all experience levels.

## Next Actions (Immediate Implementation Tasks)

The following tasks represent the first 5 priority items to begin implementation:

- [x] **Initialize basic docs/ directory structure**
  - Create docs/ directory if it doesn't exist
  - Set up getting-started/ directory only
  - Other directories will be created as needed during implementation

- [x] **Set up docs/examples/ subproject with build.gradle.kts**
  - Create subproject as part of root project (not independent)
  - Add to root settings.gradle.kts as included subproject
  - Configure Java 17 as source and target compatibility
  - Configure with Spring Boot 3.2.5 plugin (org.springframework.boot)
  - Configure with Spring Dependency Management 1.1.4 plugin (io.spring.dependency-management)
  - Disable javadoc task (not needed for examples project)
  - Configure dependencies for AutoParams and extensions
  - Set up proper source and test directory structure
  - Ensure `./gradlew build` command succeeds for entire project

- [ ] **Create domain models in docs/examples/src/main/java/examples/**
  - Implement Product, Review, Order, User classes
  - Design realistic relationships between domain objects
  - Ensure models support various AutoParams features

- [ ] **Create installation and quick-start documentation**
  - Copy installation instructions from README.md to docs/getting-started/installation.md
  - Create focused quick-start guide with minimal viable example
  - Note: README.md will remain unchanged until all docs/ work is complete

- [ ] **Create basic Factory and Designer documentation templates**
  - Establish structure for docs/core-features/factory.md
  - Establish structure for docs/core-features/designer.md
  - Include sections for basic usage, advanced patterns, and examples

These tasks can be adjusted or reordered based on project priorities and resource availability.

**Important Note**: README.md modifications will be performed as the final step after all docs/ directory work is completed. During the initial documentation creation phase, content will be copied from README.md without modifying the original file. README.md restructuring will occur only after the new documentation system is fully established and validated.
