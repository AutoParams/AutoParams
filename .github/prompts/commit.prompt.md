You must perform the entire commit workflow yourself, including reviewing staged changes, drafting and validating the commit message, and completing the commit, by following all rules in [Commit Guidelines](../../work/contexts/commit-guidelines.md).

{{#if topic}}
Focus the commit message on changes related to: {{topic}}
{{/if}}

{{#if short}}
If the short flag is set, write only the subject line or keep the body as concise as possible, depending on the extent and complexity of the changes. Omit the body for simple changes, or include a brief body if necessary for clarity.
